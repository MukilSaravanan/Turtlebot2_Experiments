# Teleoperation
- Teleoperation allows you to manually control TurtleBot. Keyboard and joystick are the two primary ways to do this. Before we experiment with these two methods, we need to set up TurtleBot to receive our commands.
- Make sure TurtleBot’s Kobuki base is turned on (on/off switch is on the side).

- The Kobuki base status light will turn green if you have sufficient battery power.
